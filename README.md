# BATTLESHIP GAME

## Overview
This is a project for my Project 1 course. I wrote it in Java, using the Java Swing package for the interface. The game is very simple: the player places ships of various lengths, ranging from 1 to 4, on a 10x10 grid. Then, the player proceeds to shoot at the ships hidden under that grid. Due to some issues, I haven't completed this project, but the framework of the program is mostly done, only missing the two-player competitive mode. Instead, I adjusted it so that the player only has 50 moves to increase the difficulty of the game.
